Abstract: Facial recognition usage in internet of things (IoT)
is now commonly used for many applications. In this project we
are stress testing a popular platform for IoT applications,
Raspberry PI 3 B+. We specifically want to see how the processor
on the PI reacts to heavy I/O using a peripheral (camera). We will
be trying to maximize processing speed by using a lightweight
Linux distribution Raspbian lite packaged with LXDE which is a
lightweight gnome desktop environment.
